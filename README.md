# Movie Rating Website: An Engaging Platform for Movie Enthusiasts

I developed a dynamic movie rating website allowing users to create lists, rate movies, view Rotten Tomatoes scores, play a custom Moviedle game, and receive personalized recommendations. This full-stack project employs MongoDB, React, Node.js, Express, and Redis to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Key Features:

- **User Authentication:** Utilizes JWT for secure authentication, safeguarding user data.
- **Movie Rating and Lists:** Users can create private or public lists and rate movies, fostering community interaction.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Implements WebSockets for real-time updates and collaboration on lists.
- **Rotten Tomatoes Integration:** Web scraper fetches scores for enhanced insights.
- **Data Caching:** Redis caching boosts performance and reduces database load.
- **Backend and Frontend Integration:** Node.js and Express manage API requests and server logic, while React creates a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Moviedle Game:** Inspired by Wordle, offers an engaging, interactive experience.
- **Personalized Recommender System:** Provides movie suggestions tailored to user preferences.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Utilizes AWS for robust, scalable hosting solutions.

## Challenges and Solutions:

- **Data Scraping and Integration:** Developed efficient techniques for accurate, up-to-date Rotten Tomatoes scores.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented Redis caching to enhance performance and reduce server load.
- **Recommender System Implementation:** Integrated a robust recommender system using machine learning.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Implemented WebSocket technology to enable seamless real-time updates for collaborative list editing.

## Current Enhancements:

- Integrating Google Maps API to display nearby cinemas and allow user ratings.
- Providing streaming service availability for a comprehensive viewing experience.

## Outcome:

This project delivered a feature-rich, user-friendly platform, showcasing my ability to work with a diverse tech stack and solve complex problems. The Moviedle game, custom recommender system, and real-time collaboration features highlight innovative approaches to user engagement and personalization for movie enthusiasts. The use of AWS for hosting demonstrates proficiency in cloud deployment and scalability, while the implementation of private and public lists adds an extra layer of user control and content management.
